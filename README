A simple KML Parser.

UPDATE:

This code is pretty old and isn't actively maintained. I believe Google deprecated ClientLogin
and as such the code won't upload the file. 

This script will parse your KML file, dump it into CSV and upload the file to the 
Google docs account you specify.

Pre-Requisites
====================
1) Beautiful Soup http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
2) Python gdata http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

If you're on a Mac the best way to install Beautiful Soup is to download and use
"python setup.py install" that worked for me!!
