A simple KML Parser.

This script will parse your KML file, dump it into CSV and upload the file to the 
Google docs account you specify.

Pre-Requisites
====================
1) Beautiful Soup http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
2) Python gdata http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

If you're on a Mac the best way to install Beautiful Soup is to download and use
"python setup.py install" that worked for me!!
